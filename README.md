Title: Using Classification Models to Guide Dietary Choices for Diabetics from Real-World Food Data

Project
Optional: find your own data set
As a suggested first step, spend some time finding a data set that you are really passionate about. This can be a data set similar to the data you have available at work or data you have always wanted to analyze. For some people this will be sports data sets, while some other folks prefer to focus on data from a datathon or data for good.

Optional: participate in a discussion board
As an optional step, go into a discussion board and brainstorm with your peers great data sets to analyze. If you prefer to skip this step, feel free to use the Ames housing data set or the Churn phone data set that we used throughout the course.

Required
Once you have selected a data set, you will produce the deliverables listed below and submit them to one of your peers for review. Treat this exercise as an opportunity to produce analysis that are ready to highlight your analytical skills for a senior audience, for example, the Chief Data Officer, or the Head of Analytics at your company.

Sections required in your report:

Main objective of the analysis that specifies whether your model will be focused on prediction or interpretation and the benefits that your analysis provides to the business or stakeholders of this data.

Brief description of the data set you chose, a summary of its attributes, and an outline of what you are trying to accomplish with this analysis.

Brief summary of data exploration and actions taken for data cleaning and feature engineering.

Summary of training at least three different classifier models, preferably of different nature in explainability and predictability. For example, you can start with a simple logistic regression as a baseline, adding other models or ensemble models. Preferably, all your models use the same training and test splits, or the same cross-validation method.

A paragraph explaining which of your classifier models you recommend as a final model that best fits your needs in terms of accuracy and explainability.

Summary Key Findings and Insights, which walks your reader through the main drivers of your model and insights from your data derived from your classifier model.

Suggestions for next steps in analyzing this data, which may include suggesting revisiting this model after adding specific data features that may help you achieve a better explanation or a better prediction.
